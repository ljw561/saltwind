Fourth attempt at artisan bread. Still a disaster.

It looks less like bread and more like some kind of geography model.

## The Poolish Situation

Here's the poolish I made after 10 hours of fermentation.

You can clearly tell the yeast isn't healthy.

This is actually a pretty good way to check if your yeast is doing okay.

## What Went Wrong

The usual suspects:

- **Not enough hydration** — the dough was too dry, which messed up gluten development
- **Weak yeast** — not enough rising power
- **Couldn't keep my hands off it** — started folding before hydration was done

Hopefully next time will be better.
