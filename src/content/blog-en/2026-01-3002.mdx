# Not Pig Face, Not Pig Skin

## How to Buy Guanciale Meat in Taiwan

Many people trying to make **Guanciale** in Taiwan for the first time don't get stuck on the curing environment or spice ratios.

They get stuck because **they bought the wrong meat from the start**.

You think you're asking for the right cut for Guanciale.

The butcher thinks you want "pig face" or "pig skin."

You get home and find:

- Skin way too thick
- Almost no meat structure
- All collagen, no depth of flavor

This isn't anyone's fault. It's just that **the names and the actual cuts don't match up**.

---

## What's the Correct Cut for Guanciale?

Here's the answer upfront. In Taiwan, you want:

> **Pork jowl (豬下巴)**

And you need to be clear about this:

- ✅ Pork jowl ≠ Pig face
- ✅ Pork jowl ≠ Pig head skin
- ✅ It's not the whole "pig face skin" sheet

Guanciale uses **the inner part of the lower jaw, near the chewing muscles**—the part of the pig that moves the most every day, where the meat flavor is most concentrated.

## Diagram: Where Guanciale Comes From on the Pig

Guanciale comes from below the face, but **doesn't include the whole face skin**.

It's concentrated in the jowl area—a zone where meat, fat, and connective tissue all intersect.

## What Should a Real "Pork Jowl" Look Like?

A proper pork jowl usually has these features:

- Shape is roughly **triangular or irregular fan-shaped**
- White fat layer on the surface
- Darker lean meat inside
- Visible muscle fibers and connective tissue layers

This structure is exactly what gives Guanciale its flavor and texture after curing.

## How to Talk to Your Butcher

❌ Don't say "Guanciale" (most butchers won't know the word)

❌ Don't say "pig face" (you'll almost certainly get the wrong thing)

Say this directly:

> "I want **pork jowl (豬下巴)**, not pig head skin."

If they're still unsure, add:

> "It's from here, the lower jaw. Has meat and fat, not the whole face skin."

And always make this key request:

> "Can you keep it as **one whole piece, not chopped up**?"

These three lines will usually get you the right thing.

## Why Is Pork Jowl Perfect for Guanciale?

Because this cut naturally meets Guanciale's three core requirements:

### 1. High fat ratio, but not dead fat

The fat here melts and smells great. After curing, it has a clear sweetness.

### 2. High chewing muscle involvement

The meat flavor is concentrated. No need to cover it up with heavy spices.

### 3. Connective tissue that holds together

It forms beautiful layers after aging, instead of crumbling or turning powdery.

This is why **real Guanciale doesn't taste greasy**—it's clean, substantial, with deep aroma.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Pig head skin**
  Too much collagen, almost no meat structure. Good for braising, not for curing.

- ❌ **Outer face meat**
  Too thin, too much skin. Unbalanced after curing.

- ❌ **Chopped jowl meat**
  Can't form the right proportions. Curing quality becomes unstable.

---

## One-Line Summary

> **To make Guanciale in Taiwan, ask for "pork jowl" (豬下巴), get it whole, and make sure it's not pig face or pig head skin.**

Get the meat right from the start, and then the salting, curing, and aging actually become worth discussing.
