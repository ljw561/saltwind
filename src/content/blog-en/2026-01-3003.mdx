I recently did something small that noticeably improved my daily life.

I bought a **small drum coffee roaster** from China. It's compact and can be **placed directly on a gas stove**.

This isn't a fully automatic, one-button machine. It's a tool that requires you to control the heat, timing, and rhythm yourself.

Fire underneath, beans tumbling, aroma slowly rising—the whole process is very direct and very honest.

The moment the beans poured into the cooling tray after roasting, the answer was already clear.

**The roast level was remarkably consistent**—even color throughout, with almost no spots that were too dark or too light.

For such a small roaster running on direct gas flame, this result was very satisfying.

The roaster comes with an **electric motor drive**, and the drum speed is adjustable.

During operation, the beans tumble evenly inside the drum—no getting stuck in corners, no dead zones where heat doesn't reach.

Heat is controlled by the gas stove, rhythm is controlled by speed and time. The whole thing feels very intuitive.

The bean selection strategy this time was clear. I used an **espresso-oriented blend**:

- **Brazilian beans**: Provide a full body, nutty and cocoa notes, serving as the flavor foundation
- **Guatemalan beans**: Add acidity, clarity, and structure to avoid a flat taste

The goal was to make something **close to Starbucks' "Medium Roast" style**—not chasing floral notes or high acidity, but balance, cleanliness, and drinkability, suitable for espresso extraction.

The aroma after roasting was quite pleasant: nutty, caramelized sugar, and cocoa powder as the main notes, with no harshness or over-carbonized bitterness.

Overall, this small roaster offers a **great user experience**:

- Intuitive operation
- Quick heat response
- High roasting consistency
- Easy to clean and store

It's not for people who want "fully automatic everything," but it's **perfect for those who enjoy hands-on control over fire and time**.

Next step: let the beans rest for a few days, then move on to espresso extraction testing.
