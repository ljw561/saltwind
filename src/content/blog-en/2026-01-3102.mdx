title: "Weekend Hunter's Sausage: 18 Hours from Fresh to Semi-Dried"
description: "This isn't a German dried sausage, nor a Taiwanese fresh sausage. It's a hunter's sausage that stops at the border: short-term drying, no curing salt, no fermentation—all just to prepare the structure and flavor."

## Starting Point: Meat, Pure and Simple

This batch of hunter's sausage was never meant to go down the "curing" path.

No fermentation. No curing salt. No smoking.

The goal was clear:

**A sausage that can be pan-fried, frozen, and safely eaten—but with flavor that isn't flat.**

The first step was simply cutting the meat to the right size for grinding and getting it cold.

The point here isn't to "freeze" it, but to **prepare the structure so it can be controlled**.

## Grinding and Mixing: Drawing Out Structure Without Using It Up

Using an 8 mm plate, ground once.

Not going for fine texture—keeping some grain.

The mixing has only one purpose:

**Let the salt pull out the myosin, let the meat "start wanting to stick together."**

Stop at the point where it's "almost jelly-like, but not overdone."

This state is crucial, because the next 18 hours aren't about more processing—they're about letting it rest.

## After Stuffing, the Real Work Begins

After stuffing into natural hog casings, the sausages didn't go straight into the fridge or freezer.

Instead, they were hung up in a cold environment with airflow for **18 hours of short-term drying**.

This "drying" isn't for preservation.

It's doing three things:

1. **Slow dehydration**
   Surface water activity drops, so when you heat it later, it won't "boil" first.

2. **Structure repositioning**
   The proteins pulled tight during mixing shift from tense to stable in the cold.

3. **Even spice distribution**
   Juniper and sweet clover don't explode in the first bite—they show up later.

## 18 Hours Is a Deliberate Stopping Point

This isn't a dried sausage.

But it's no longer a freshly stuffed fresh sausage either.

At this point, the sausage:

- Surface is dry, not sticky
- Springs back slowly when pressed
- Still soft inside
- Clean aroma, no sourness or stuffiness

This is the right moment to hit pause.

From here, you can choose to:

- Vacuum seal and freeze, preserving the semi-dried fresh state
- Or refrigerate for 1–2 more days before freezing
- Or just pan-fry one to check the direction

## About the Color: It Doesn't Really Matter

This sausage won't turn red when cooked.

No curing salt means no ham-pink color.

No fermentation means no aged-red color.

What you get is **honest cooked meat color**.

If it ever turns bright red, that actually means you went the wrong way.

## Conclusion: This Isn't Waiting, It's Preparation Complete

These 18 hours aren't about letting time pass.

They're about letting the meat, fat, and spices complete half of what they need to do—before any heat is applied.

**Not curing, not preserving.**

**Just a sausage learning how to be pan-fried.**
