## 2kg Sea Bream × 7 Days of Aging × Using Every Part

This time I worked with a sea bream weighing about 2 kilograms.

I chose to age it for a full 7 days — not to chase some extreme flavor change, but to let the meat "calm down." The tight muscle fibers slowly relax into something more delicate, with a cleaner sweetness.

Not a single part of this fish went to waste.

## Aging Setup and Approach

Before aging, only three things matter:

1. **Proper bleeding and cleaning**
   Gills, blood lines, belly cavity — all need to be cleaned well. This is the foundation for stable flavor later on.

2. **Low temperature, dry, no moisture**
   Pat the whole fish dry, wrap it, and refrigerate with humidity control. Let the surface water activity drop naturally — no need to force it with salt or seasoning.

3. **Patience**
   7 days isn't long, but it's enough for the sea bream to go from "freshly dead and stiff" to "sweetness coming through."

## Butchering: Breaking Down the Fish

After aging, I filleted it Japanese-style (sanmai oroshi) and split the meat by use:

- **Back and belly fillets** → hot pot slices
- **Fattier mid-belly section** → hand-pressed sushi
- **Skin-on pieces with good flavor** → blanched sashimi (yushimo)
- **Head and bones** → roasted, then made into soup

This isn't about showing off. It's about respecting each cut and letting it shine where it belongs.

## Hot Pot Slices: Sweet, Tender, Clean

Aged sea bream, sliced thin and dipped briefly in boiling water:

- No fishy smell
- Doesn't fall apart
- What you taste is a clear sweetness — not "fishiness"

Good fish for hot pot doesn't need a heavy broth. The fish speaks for itself.

## Hand-Pressed Sushi: Where Aging Really Shines

The mid-belly portion became sushi — the part I was most excited about.

After 7 days of aging:

- The texture is no longer crunchy, but refined
- Not much fat, but it spreads evenly
- When you press the rice, the fish just settles right in

This is the kind of sushi that doesn't hit you hard, but you keep reaching for the next piece.

## Blanched Sashimi: Unlocking the Skin

Blanching (yushimo) isn't about cooking the fish. It's about releasing the aroma trapped under the skin.

A quick dip in hot water, then straight into ice water:

- The skin tightens
- The gelatin comes out
- The fragrance becomes fuller than plain sashimi

This dish usually gets the biggest reaction from people who really know their fish.

## Head and Bones: Not Scraps — The Soul

The head and bones were roasted dry first, then simmered into hot pot broth.

This step matters:

- Roasting converts the fishy smell into nutty, sea-like notes
- The soup stays clear, not cloudy
- Even when cooled, it's not greasy or sticky

The final broth is the summary of the whole fish's flavor.

## Final Thoughts

This 2kg sea bream — from aging, to butchering, to serving — didn't need any fancy techniques. Just one principle:

**Let each part be eaten in the way it's most comfortable with.**

A fish isn't just an ingredient. It's a process.

And aging just makes that process clearer.

If you're willing to spend the time, it will always pay you back.
