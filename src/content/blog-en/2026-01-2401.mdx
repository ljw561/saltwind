I've always had this habit of posting bits of my life on Facebook.

Nothing major — just things that felt like "if I don't write this down now, it'll disappear."

But Facebook is too messy for that. The timeline keeps pushing forward, and stuff gets buried fast. Even I can't be bothered to dig through it.

And I happen to be the kind of person who likes to take things slow. Especially when it comes to fermentation — it's basically a hobby made for lazy people. You just pick the right direction, and let time do the rest.

"Salt and wind" might sound poetic, but what it actually means is pretty simple —

Letting food lose water, settle, and transform over time, until it becomes something else entirely.

Does it get better? Honestly, I don't know.

What I do know is that I really enjoy this rhythm.

Slow, predictable, and hands-off.

So I brought that rhythm here. This isn't a tutorial site or a showcase. It's just me, recording how I live and how I make things — exactly as they are.

If you're the kind of person who likes to take it slow too, you'll probably get what I'm writing about.
