This batch is Taiwanese Arabica coffee cherries.

Nothing added.

No salt, no sugar, no water, and no deliberate inoculation.

Just fully ripe coffee cherries, de-stemmed and vacuum-sealed, entering an anaerobic environment.

## Conditions

- Processing method: **Whole Cherry Anaerobic**
- Additives: **None**
- Ambient temperature: About **18°C**
- Vacuum level: High vacuum
- Package weight: About 2–3 kg each

This temperature matters.

18°C isn't meant to slow down fermentation. It's to let the native microflora complete their "selection" first, rather than racing from the start.

Before vacuum sealing, all cherries went through a quick hand sort.

Not aiming for perfection — just removing obviously overripe, damaged, or abnormal fruit.

## Expected Timeline

For the first 12 hours, almost nothing visible will happen.

This period isn't about "fermentation." It's about establishing anaerobic conditions, letting the environment inside the skin and flesh shift on its own.

Around 12 hours in, I expect water to start releasing.

The cell walls of the skin get opened up by internal osmotic pressure and enzymes. Pectin liquid begins to flow — a natural result.

---

## Next Steps (Not Yet Done)

Once water release begins, I'll do a gentle **through-the-bag pressing and massage**:

- No opening the bag
- No crushing the fruit
- Just redistributing the released pectin liquid

This step isn't about speeding things up. It's about preventing localized runaway fermentation.

---

## Why Add Nothing?

Because I want to know:

**Where will these beans go on their own, with zero intervention?**

No salt for control. No sugar to push things forward. No water to dilute flavor.

Just temperature, time, and the fruit itself.

---

This batch will be stopped at the right moment. Then I'll decide whether to sun-dry, honey-process, or simply keep it as an experimental sample.
