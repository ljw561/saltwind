In Germany, Jäger-style sausage doesn't rely on heavy smoke or strong spices.

The real hunter's flavor comes from **properly handled fat and clean, restrained aromas**.

This recipe deliberately **skips smoking**, using juniper berries and Bohnenkraut (summer savory) to build that forest character and maturity. The result is a sausage that stays stable and safe in Taiwan's humid climate while keeping its full flavor.

## What kind of sausage is this?
- Type: Fresh sausage (must be cooked before eating)
- Flavor profile: Low sweetness, clean, forest-like, mature but not greasy
- Inspiration: German hunter's sausage (not fermented, not raw)
- Best enjoyed: Pan-fried over low heat, paired with drinks

> This isn't a Taiwanese night market sausage, nor is it a German raw sausage. It's a fresh hunter-style sausage following German butcher logic.

---

## Yield
- **10 Taiwan jin = 6 kg of meat filling**

---

## Ingredient Ratios

### Meat Composition
- Lean meat (leg or shoulder) **4.2 kg (70%)**
- Back fat **1.8 kg (30%)**

> Keep meat temperature at **0–2°C** throughout to prevent the fat from getting smashed up.

---

## Base Seasoning (low sweetness, clean)

| Ingredient | Amount |
|---|---|
| Salt | 114 g |
| Sugar | 42 g |
| Soy sauce | 75 g |
| White wine / rice wine | 150 g |
| White pepper | 9 g |
| Black pepper (coarse) | 12 g |

The sugar is just for rounding out the flavor, not for that sweet Taiwanese-style taste.

## The Soul Spices of Hunter Style

| Spice | Amount | How to use |
|---|---|---|
| Bohnenkraut (summer savory) | 2.4 g | Crumble by hand |
| Juniper berries | 24 pieces | Crack and roughly chop |

### How to prep juniper berries
1. Lightly crack with the back of a knife
2. Roughly chop 2–3 times
3. Pieces should be about the size of coarse pepper

> Don't grind to powder. Don't put them through the meat grinder. This prevents bitterness and that medicinal taste.

---

## Grinding Settings
- Plate: **8 mm**
- One pass is enough
- Chill immediately after grinding

The coarse texture is key to the hunter sausage's mouthfeel and flavor.

---

## Mixing Order (don't change this)
1. Ground meat + salt → Mix until tacky and can pull strings
2. Add wine
3. Add soy sauce, sugar, pepper
4. **Add Bohnenkraut and juniper last**

Mix just until everything comes together. Don't over-emulsify.

---

## Stuffing
- Use natural hog casings
- Prick with a needle to release air after stuffing
- Tie off every 12–15 cm

---

## Drying (the key for the unsmoked version)
- Temperature: **18–24°C**
- Environment: Good airflow, no direct light, no direct breeze
- Time: **12–18 hours**

### How to tell it's ready
- Surface is dry, not sticky
- Casing has tension
- Inside is still soft

This step creates the maturity that smoking would normally provide.

---

## How to Cook

### Best method
**Low and slow pan-fry**
- Don't poke the casing
- Low heat to render fat
- Let it color naturally

### Safe option
**Steam at 70–75°C → then pan-fry to color**

> This product **cannot be eaten raw**.

---

## Flavor Profile
- First bite: Not sweet, not greasy
- Middle: Meat flavor with forest herbs
- Finish: Clean, mature, great with drinks

---

## The Core Idea Behind This Sausage
Real hunter's sausage doesn't rely on smoke or heavy spices.
It's about handling the fat properly and letting the aromas come through naturally.

---

**Key Reminders**
- Don't fry over high heat
- Don't skip proper drying
- Don't mistake this for a raw-eating sausage

---

> **Real hunter's sausage doesn't need smoke.
It needs fat that's been handled clean.**
